RFdiffusion Streamlit App: Interactive Interface for Protein Design

The RFdiffusion Streamlit App is an interactive web-based application that allows users to explore various protein design tasks using the RFdiffusion tool. Through a user-friendly interface, the app provides options for three key tasks: Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Binder Design, Symmetric Oligomer Design, and Symmetric Motif Scaffolding. Users can select the desired task, specify relevant parameters, and initiate the generation of protein designs.

For each task, the app presents input fields for users to enter relevant information, such as the target residues for binder design, the symmetry type for symmetric oligomer design, and the parameters for symmetric motif scaffolding. Upon providing the necessary inputs, users can initiate the design process and receive example outputs based on the chosen task.

Please note that this app is for demonstration purposes only and serves as an interface for users to interact with the RFdiffusion tool. The actual implementation of RFdiffusion's complex functionalities is not included in this app. Instead, it focuses on showcasing how users would interact with RFdiffusion and provides placeholders for the expected outputs.
